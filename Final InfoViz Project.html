			<pre style="margin-left: 20%;font-family: Lato; line-height: 1.5;">
	<b>	1.	2021, UK gas demand rose by 5.4 per cent compared to 2020, reaching 854 TWh.</b>
			This increase reflected an easing of lockdown restrictions from spring until the end
			of the year, reduced renewables generation, and increased nuclear demand
			for electricity generation. The easing of restrictions predominantly increased 
			demand across the industrial, commercial and public sectors.
			
	<b>	2.	Gas production reached a record low in 2021 at 363 TWh, 47 TWh below the 
			previous record low in 2013.</b> This was a 17 per cent fall compared to 2020 and was 
			primarily the result of scheduled maintenance, including a shutdown of the Forties 
			Pipeline System (FPS) which serves a significant proportion of UK oil and gas 
			production. To meet demand, imports of natural gas increased by 17 per cent, and 
			exports fell by 29 per cent to the lowest level since 1998. This resulted in a 30 per cent 
			increase in net imports. The rise in imports was driven by increased pipeline imports, 
			up 44 per cent; imports of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) fell by 22 per cent. 
			
	<b>	3.	Quarter 4 2021 saw a 6.3 per cent fall in demand for natural gas compared with 
			Quarter 4 2020</b>. This was due to reduced demand for electricity generation and warmer 
			quarterly temperatures reducing domestic demand. Production continued to increase from
			the summer lows but was down 1.7 per cent on the same period in the previous year. Net
			imports fell 17 per cent in Quarter 4 2021, primarily due to significant exports in October.
			Imports of LNG remained substantial but were down 5.5 per cent compared with
			Quarter 4 2020.
